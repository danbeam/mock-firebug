ensureConsole.js

This file allows you to leave all your favorite Firebug commands
i.e. console.log, console.clear, etc. in your code in dev or
production and it *shouldn't* result in any errors (an object
of empty functions containing the same object attribute names
is inserted into the Firebug console's place).

However, leaving this code in production is still probably
not advisable, as additional logging/debugging lines in
your code will cost you in network bandwidth and wastes
of time in simply every call to a blank function unnecessarilly.
